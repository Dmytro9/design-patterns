# Design Patterns

## Creational:

Flexible creation of objects without introducing unnecessary dependencies into the program.

- #### Singleton

  - Applicability
    1. Provide one object or array of shared data for all modules (Logger class with Array of logs).
    2. Data base connection
  - Issues:
    1. A lot of mocks in unit testing.

- #### Builder

  - Applicability
    1. An easy way to create complex objects with optional/additional parameters.

- #### Prototype
  - Applicability
    1. Creates objects based on template of an existing object and cloning it, and make some possibile modification in new the clone.

## Behavioral:

Show different ways of building relationships between objects.

## Structural:

Take care of effective communication between objects.
