## Design Patterns

---

### Creational:

Flexible creation of objects without introducing unnecessary dependencies into the program.

- Singleton
  - Issues:
    1. A lot of mocks in unit testing.
    2. A high chance of unexpected data mutation by different modules

### Behavioral:

Show different ways of building relationships between objects.

### Structural:

Take care of effective communication between objects.
