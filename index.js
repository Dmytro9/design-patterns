    Constructor - class -> constructor(){}
    Factory - class -> create(){}

    Singeltone - in app only one instance of this class (db)




    STRUCTURAL:

    Adapter - old interface with new methods
    Decorator - modify / extend class and return it
    Facade - public interface for simplifying communication between classes
    Flyweight - 
    Proxy - new Proxy(fn, {})



    BEHAVIOR: (communication between objects of different types)

    Chain-of-responsability - in class return this and can chain methods
